    "Hello, and welcome to the Intro to Python Programming tutorial notebook! This notebook is adapted from an excellent tutorial called *Data Analysis Example: Analyzing Movie Ratings with Python* by Cagdas Yetkin. You can check out the original tutorial [here](https://codingnomads.co/blog/data-analysis-example-analyzing-movie-ratings-with-python/), and the corresponding GitHub code [here](https://github.com/CodingNomads/movie-analysis-python-pandas/blob/master/movie-analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to get you quickly up to speed with some of the basics of Python programming (and programming in general!) and data manipulation. Instead of learning Python in a series of isolated and generic examples, we are going to try learning it with a contextualized example that will have immediate applications to scRNA-seq analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "How exactly does a tutorial based on movie ratings connect to scRNA-seq analysis? It all comes down to `pandas`, a popular Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. When you do scRNA-seq analysis using `scanpy`, you are using a `pandas` dataframe to store, manipulate, and analyze your data. So, if we can start learning how to use `pandas` now, some aspects of scRNA-seq analysis will make a lot more sense once we get to them!"

    "First, before we analyze any data, we have to have data to analyze. We are going to be using data from the [Movie Tweetings Project](https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings/tree/master/latest). This data consists of movie ratings from Twitter since 2013, updated daily. The data was created from people who connected their IMDB profile with their Twitter accounts. Whenever they rated a movie on the IMDB website, an automated process generated a standard, well-structured tweet. We can use this data to learn and practice data analysis using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a new directory in our */workspace/intro_to_programming/* folder called *data*. There are two ways you can do this. You can open a terminal, navigate into */workspace/intro_to_programming/* using the `cd` command, and then make a data directory by using the `mkdir` command (i.e., `mkdir data`). Or, you can click on the new folder icon in the left sidebar and change to label to *data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have created our *data* directory, we need to download our data files. There are three:\n",
    "* *movies.dat* (`https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings/raw/master/latest/movies.dat`)\n",
    "* *ratings.dat* (`https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings/raw/master/latest/ratings.dat`)\n",
    "* *users.dat* (`https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings/raw/master/latest/users.dat`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's download these using our terminal. Open a terminal, and navigate into the *data* directory. Now, use the `wget` command to download each of the three links (i.e., copy the *movies.dat* link, and run `wget <LINK>` in the terminal. Repeat for the *ratings.dat* and *users.dat* links). After you have downloaded all three files, if you type `ls -l` in the terminal, you should see those three files now listed in your data directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! We have data! Let's take a peek and see what it looks like.\n",

So we have two data fields, which are separated by `::`. Data fields can be divided by all sorts of different separators, and it's good to know which one is used in that data you are working with. Most often, you will probably see commas or tabs used as separators.\n",

It provides some generic functionality that can be used by specific applications. \n",

    "Now that our coding environment is set up, we can read our files into pandas dataframes. In order to do this, we will use the `read_csv` function in `pandas`.

For example, [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) is `.read_csv()` page in the `pandas` API. You can see that it can take in way more parameters than we will provide. A *required* parameter is something like the *filepath_or_buffer* parameter. You have to pass `.read_csv()` some sort of file to read. An *optional* parameter is something like the *sep* parameter. You don't have to pass `.read_csv()` a delimiter, and if you don't it will default to a comma. In our case, we will pass `read_csv` a *sep* parameter.)"
